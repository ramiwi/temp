>> Any evidence that lower protein diet has negative impact on non training/athlet adults?


Absolutely. There is significant and growing evidence that a protein intake at or near the current Recommended Dietary Allowance ($\text{0.8 g/kg/day}$) is often **detrimental to the health of older adults and may not be optimal for many non-youth people**, regardless of their training status.

The main concern centers on **Sarcopenia** (age-related loss of muscle mass and function).

### Key Evidence for Non-Youth and Non-Bodybuilders

#### 1. Increased Protein Needs with Age

As people age (starting around $\text{40-50}$), the body becomes less efficient at utilizing dietary protein to build and maintain muscle. This phenomenon, known as **"anabolic resistance,"** means older adults need a higher protein intake to stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) compared to younger adults.

* **Sarcopenia Risk:** Studies consistently link lower protein intake in older adults to an increased risk of sarcopenia, frailty, and mobility limitation. One meta-analysis found the risk of sarcopenia was significantly higher in the group with protein intake $<\text{0.8 g/kg/day}$ compared to those in the $\text{0.8-1.2 g/kg/day}$ range.
* **Expert Consensus:** Leading international nutrition and geriatric expert groups (like PROT-AGE) now recommend protein intakes **significantly higher** than the RDA for older adults:
    * **Healthy Older Adults:** $\text{1.0 - 1.2 g/kg/day}$
    * **Older Adults with Acute or Chronic Illness/Injury:** $\text{1.2 - 1.5 g/kg/day}$

#### 2. Negative Impact on Bone Health

Protein is crucial for bone health because it provides the structure (collagen matrix) on which minerals are deposited.

* **Bone Density:** Contrary to older myths, modern research suggests that a protein intake **above the RDA** (when paired with adequate calcium and Vitamin D) is associated with **higher Bone Mineral Density (BMD)**, a slower rate of bone loss, and a modestly reduced risk of hip fractures in older adults.
* **Hip Fracture Recovery:** Correcting poor protein nutrition in elderly patients recovering from a hip fracture has been shown to improve clinical outcomes and potentially shorten hospital stays.

#### 3. Impaired Recovery, Immunity, and Overall Function

The consequences of a "low" protein diet (at or near the $\text{0.8 g/kg/day}$ RDA) in older, non-bodybuilding individuals include:

* **Impaired Wound Healing:** Protein is essential for tissue repair.
* **Decreased Immune Function:** Antibodies and many immune system components are proteins.
* **Loss of Function:** Lower muscle mass directly leads to decreased physical performance, increased risk of falls, loss of independence, and poorer quality of life.

### Conclusion: The $\text{0.8 g/kg/day}$ RDA is a Minimum, Not an Optimal Target

The $\text{0.8 g/kg/day}$ RDA was established based on nitrogen balance studies in **young, sedentary men** to prevent outright protein deficiency. For anyone over the age of $\text{40}$ or $\text{50}$, or those with even minimal physical activity, it is widely considered a low and often inadequate intake for maintaining optimal muscle mass, strength, and overall health.

  **Description:** Higher protein intakes may help prevent age-related sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass, and strength that predisposes older adults to frailty, disability, and loss of independence.

  **Description:** Once you're between the ages of 40 and 50, sarcopenia — losing muscle mass as you age — begins to set in. To prevent this and to maintain independence and quality of life, your protein needs increase to about 1 gram per kilogram of body weight.

  **Description:** In the elderly with osteoporosis, higher protein intake (≥ 0.8 g/kg body weight/day, i.e., above the current RDA) may be recommended. Correction of poor protein nutrition in patients with a recent hip fracture has been shown to improve clinical outcomes. The duration of hospital stay is shortened, and mortality rates are reduced.

  **Description:** This contributes to impaired wound healing, loss of skin elasticity, and an inability to fight infection. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is often insufficient for older adults. The importance of dietary protein cannot be underestimated in the diets of older adults; inadequate protein intake contributes to a decrease in reserve capacity, increased skin fragility, decreased immune function, poorer healing, and longer recuperation from illness.
