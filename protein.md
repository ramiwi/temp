Absolutely. There is significant and growing evidence that a protein intake at or near the current Recommended Dietary Allowance ($\text{0.8 g/kg/day}$) is often **detrimental to the health of older adults and may not be optimal for many non-youth people**, regardless of their training status.

The main concern centers on **Sarcopenia** (age-related loss of muscle mass and function).

### Key Evidence for Non-Youth and Non-Bodybuilders

#### 1. Increased Protein Needs with Age

As people age (starting around $\text{40-50}$), the body becomes less efficient at utilizing dietary protein to build and maintain muscle. This phenomenon, known as **"anabolic resistance,"** means older adults need a higher protein intake to stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) compared to younger adults.

* **Sarcopenia Risk:** Studies consistently link lower protein intake in older adults to an increased risk of sarcopenia, frailty, and mobility limitation. One meta-analysis found the risk of sarcopenia was significantly higher in the group with protein intake $<\text{0.8 g/kg/day}$ compared to those in the $\text{0.8-1.2 g/kg/day}$ range.
* **Expert Consensus:** Leading international nutrition and geriatric expert groups (like PROT-AGE) now recommend protein intakes **significantly higher** than the RDA for older adults:
    * **Healthy Older Adults:** $\text{1.0 - 1.2 g/kg/day}$
    * **Older Adults with Acute or Chronic Illness/Injury:** $\text{1.2 - 1.5 g/kg/day}$

#### 2. Negative Impact on Bone Health

Protein is crucial for bone health because it provides the structure (collagen matrix) on which minerals are deposited.

* **Bone Density:** Contrary to older myths, modern research suggests that a protein intake **above the RDA** (when paired with adequate calcium and Vitamin D) is associated with **higher Bone Mineral Density (BMD)**, a slower rate of bone loss, and a modestly reduced risk of hip fractures in older adults.
* **Hip Fracture Recovery:** Correcting poor protein nutrition in elderly patients recovering from a hip fracture has been shown to improve clinical outcomes and potentially shorten hospital stays.

#### 3. Impaired Recovery, Immunity, and Overall Function

The consequences of a "low" protein diet (at or near the $\text{0.8 g/kg/day}$ RDA) in older, non-bodybuilding individuals include:

* **Impaired Wound Healing:** Protein is essential for tissue repair.
* **Decreased Immune Function:** Antibodies and many immune system components are proteins.
* **Loss of Function:** Lower muscle mass directly leads to decreased physical performance, increased risk of falls, loss of independence, and poorer quality of life.

### Conclusion: The $\text{0.8 g/kg/day}$ RDA is a Minimum, Not an Optimal Target

The $\text{0.8 g/kg/day}$ RDA was established based on nitrogen balance studies in **young, sedentary men** to prevent outright protein deficiency. For anyone over the age of $\text{40}$ or $\text{50}$, or those with even minimal physical activity, it is widely considered a low and often inadequate intake for maintaining optimal muscle mass, strength, and overall health.
